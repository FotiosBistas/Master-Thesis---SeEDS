\section{Introduction}

A \textit{Data Space}, in the sense defined by ETSI ( European Telecommunications Standard Institute ), is a standards-based way
for many independent organizations to make their data discoverable and usable
to one another while each party keeps control of its own data. Instead of
moving everything into one central database, participants adopt common formats,
interfaces, and policies (identity, consent, usage rules) so they can share
data securely and auditably across organizational boundaries. This model aims
to break down today’s “data silos” ( isolated collections of data that prevent data sharing ) and enable new services that combine data
from multiple sources.

This differs from proprietary Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). CDNs focus on
fast distribution of static content (e.g., web assets, video) through
infrastructure operated by a single provider. In contrast, a Data Space
prioritizes interoperability, governance, and data sovereignty across many
owners, rather than speed of delivery from one centralized platform.

We have already implemented a simple Data Space based on the \textit{Named Data Networking (NDN)} architecture, in our previous project \textit{NGI Sargasso OC1 SNDS}. This system supported advanced data-driven applications over a fully distributed and self-sovereign identity framework, demonstrating performance and scalability advantages over traditional IP-based networks.

Building upon SNDS, the \textit{Secure and Efficient Data Spaces (SeEDS)} project aims to deliver an ETSI-compliant Data Space solution. The project provides implementations for all required data API operations, including content filtering based on user-defined conditions, as well as optional temporal API operations that enable long-term data storage and retrieval. Specifically, this thesis implements the following goals regarding SeEDS:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement the full NGSI-LD API, including content filtering, temporal operations and event subscriptions.  
    \item Enhance data space efficiency by providing distributed data intermediaries and migrating content filters to their optimal location.
    \item Test the SeEDS implementation over the worldwide NDN testbed. 
\end{itemize}

The NGSI-LD API is a standardized interface for managing and exchanging
\emph{context information} in data spaces, as specified by ETSI. It provides a
common, HTTP-based framework that lets content providers, consumers, and
brokering services create, update, and query \emph{entities}, as well as
subscribe to change events. In NGSI-LD, each entity is represented in JSON-LD
and usually consists of a globally unique \texttt{id}, a \texttt{type} (its class),
and a set of \emph{attributes}. Attributes are either \emph{Properties} (values,
optionally with metadata such as \texttt{observedAt} or \texttt{unitCode}) or
\emph{Relationships} (links to other entities). A JSON-LD \texttt{@context}
binds the terms used to well-defined IRIs, ensuring semantic interoperability.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={Example JSON-LD},label={lst:ngsi-ld-json}]
{ 
"@id": "urn:seeds:Car:001,
"@type": "Car,
"brand":{
    "type": "Property,
    "value": "BW
},
"dateVehicleFirstRegistered": { 
    "type": "Property
    "value": "201
    "emissionsCO2":{
        "type": "Property,
        "value": "2
    }
},
"@context":[
    "https://example.com/context.jsonl
] 
} 
\end{lstlisting}

This enables SeEDS to support two retrieval modes over its HTTP API: by \texttt{@id} and by \texttt{@type}.
A \emph{GET by ID} request retrieves a single JSON-LD entity given its globally
unique \texttt{@id}. A \emph{GET by TYPE} request retrieves all entities that
match the provided \texttt{@type}. Since \texttt{@type} is optional in SeEDS,
entities that omit it are treated as having the default \texttt{GENERIC} type.

\noindent\textbf{HTTP usage}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{GET by ID}: returns one entity
  \begin{verbatim}
  GET /?id=urn:seeds:car:car001
  \end{verbatim}

  \item \textbf{GET by TYPE}: returns an array of entities
  \begin{verbatim}
  GET /?type=Vehicle
  \end{verbatim}

  \item \textbf{Implicit type (default)}: entities without @type are treated as
  \texttt{GENERIC}
  \begin{verbatim}
  GET /?type=GENERIC
  \end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Response shape}
\begin{itemize}
  \item GET by ID $\rightarrow$ a single JSON-LD object (the entity).
  \item GET by TYPE $\rightarrow$ a JSON array of JSON-LD entities.
\end{itemize}
